Questions/Uncertainties regarding assignment


1. Will the "cancel" function only receive inputs that are at the start of
    already assigned intervals? (no inputs in the middle of busy intervals?)

2. Will we ever need to merge "busy" times?

3. createSchedule creates initial idle node?

4. Should we close file after printSchedule?

5. Will argument int room in cancelReservation be index or room num (start at 0 or 1)?

6. Is findReservations and printReservations the only functions that use the rNode
    and reservation structs?
